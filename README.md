Well, here we have a really special repository where I decided to share all my achievements involving Machine Learning stuff. The progress made so far has been built on platforms such as Coursera, Data Science Academy, Udacity and books from O'Reilly. In this repository, each folder is a course/specialization with detailed content that can help anyone interested on this universe!

- ![#DD3867](https://placehold.it/15/DD3867/000000?text=+) `Hands On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn & TensorFlow`
  - This [excellent book](https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1492032646/ref=asc_df_1492032646/?tag=googleshopp00-20&linkCode=df0&hvadid=379733272930&hvpos=1o2&hvnetw=g&hvrand=8277952614002345206&hvpone=&hvptwo=&hvqmt=&hvdev=c&hvdvcmdl=&hvlocint=&hvlocphy=1001767&hvtargid=pla-523968811896&psc=1) from O'Reilly simply brings the practical Data Science and Machine Learning to another level! I consider this book a trully life-change.

- ![#383CDD](https://placehold.it/15/383CDD/000000?text=+) `Machine Learning from Stanford University`
  - No doubts that [this Machine Learning Course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning?utm_source=gg&utm_medium=sem&utm_content=07-StanfordML-LATAM&campaignid=6516185036&adgroupid=78655656872&device=c&keyword=machine%20learning%20mooc&matchtype=b&network=g&devicemodel=&adpostion=1t1&creativeid=383457498872&hide_mobile_promo&gclid=CjwKCAiAi4fwBRBxEiwAEO8_Hpz1j4qR_mfqB5uJRnf6DP1Dhz-_r9Ua0tVbE19MWt23dCyvY5OPmBoCRbQQAvD_BwE) opened many doors in my professional career. This was my first contact with Coursera and, as long as I've been looking for understanding the theory behind those Machine Learning algorithms, Andrew Ng just bring to me everything I needed! I recommend this for everyone!
  
- ![#E0F66D](https://placehold.it/15/E0F66D/000000?text=+) `Data Science Academy`
  - Here we have a brazilian reference with top level quality. With [DSA](https://www.datascienceacademy.com.br/) I had the first contact with Python and I just noticed the reasons why people talked so much on Big Data, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. I really want to keep my journey on DSA doing more and more specializations.
  
- ![#6FCBF1](https://placehold.it/15/6FCBF1/000000?text=+) `Udacity`
  - [Udacity Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025) brought me a valueable knowledge for that time. With the Fundamentals of Data Scientist 1 I was able to first apply concepts of Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and Seaborn) to solve real world problems.
  
- ![#D70B45](https://placehold.it/15/D70B45/000000?text=+) `Udemy`
  - [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) is a really rich platform that helped me so much when I was starting my Data Science journey. With them I was able to look at some good courses with a low price.
